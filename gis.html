          <h2>What is GIS?</h2>
          <p>GIS (Geographic Information Systems) is a tool for managing, analyzing, and visualizing geographic data. In earthquake detection, it plays a critical role by:
            Collecting and Analyzing Seismic Data: Monitors seismic activity to identify potential earthquake zones.
            Real-Time Monitoring: Maps real-time data to locate epicenters and affected areas.
            Hazard Mapping: Identifies high-risk zones for future preparedness.
            Damage Assessment and Response: Assists in post-earthquake rescue and relief efforts.
            Early Warning and Risk Management: Integrates with early warning systems to predict and mitigate earthquake impacts.
            GIS helps scientists and emergency responders better understand, predict, and manage earthquake-related risks.</p>

          <h2>Earthquake Detection</h2>
          <p>Earthquake detection using GIS involves integrating real-time seismic data from sensors and accelerometers to monitor earth movements. GIS helps by:
            Real-Time Data Mapping: Maps seismic activity to quickly locate earthquake epicenters.
            Pattern Analysis: Analyzes historical and current seismic data to identify high-risk zones.
            Alert Systems: Works with early warning systems to detect abnormal movements and send alerts.
            Damage Assessment: Visualizes affected areas post-event, guiding emergency response.
            By combining location data with seismic information, GIS enables effective earthquake detection, warning, and response.</p>
